## GreenBin - A way to sustainable Future

The name of our website is GreenBin. The website is created using HTML and CSS. This is a basic website that aims at motivating others to protect the environment by recycling the inevitable enemy of nature- "PLASTICS". In this website the users can create their own materials and sell it online through our website or through any other media. This approach helps the people to generate a passive income and also develop their sense of creativity
